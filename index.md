## Firework BLOCK CHAIN
### Peek structure of hierarchy block chain

The theory mainly elaborate what is Firework block 
chain, and itâ€™s key implementation, including 
consensus, hierarchy, network and high performance 
algorithm, meanwhile, also telling Firework block 
chain usage sense, how to use it to constitute a 
digital currency biosphere, development advice and 
running environments.

## Summary description

### Block chain
<p>What the hell is block chain? For this question, author ponders for a long time 
before write this, but has no absolutely answer about that, after taking the actual 
action and make unremitting probe, and find the follow conclusion by it shelf
finally.</p>
<p>In the true, block chain is one serious data that generate by different district, 
and organized to be a chain, the chain has traceability of data from, and anyone 
can recognize that, but cannot change it.</p>
<p>Block chain is a database that running in distributed account book with 
consensus mechanism. The meaning of this technique is shading the retrospect 
able transaction data for anyone, so that achieve the decentralization. Besides, 
technique traits of block chain using the machine to machine supplant the human 
to human mechanism and dislodge the suspicion in human.</p>

### Digital currency

<p>Digital currency definition so wide, the understanding of digital currency of 
pseudonym is that, must has cipher effect, safely transport in consensus 
mechanism, initiated by finance purpose and serve the finance business, the estate 
in Firework account book not allowed manual modify to increase the amount, but 
how much estate one address has, anyone can seem clearly. But, the address 
cannot fetch the people name, so you only can know the property of address; never 
know the property of people.</p>
<p>Original Firework block chain not proffer ability of currency mine, but we can 
implements privately, we can predestine one batch of address that contains balance 
and missing token, one must figure out the match token by a lot of computing try, 
so that the token satisfied predestine account verification, if so, one can transmit 
the balance of this address to their own address. Besides, we also can make many 
conduct transaction, but the data not completed, miner must figure out the missing 
data make it through the verification, so that can impel the miner to mining.</p>
